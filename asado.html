    <h1>This is 'Asado'</h1>
    <p>Every animal that walks goes to the spit. Despite its rudimentary, almost savage character, asado is a ritual and a promise, and its mystical essence is evident because it gives the men who gather to prepare and eat it in company the illusion of a profound coincidence with the place in which they live.</p>

    <h1>Here we go, we need only those ingredients: </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Kg de carne de vacuno (de tira, vacío, entraña, matambre, falda parrillera, entre otros cortes).</li>
        <li>2 Morcillas</li>
        <li>2 Chorizos</li>
        <li>1 riñón</li>
        <li>Carbón o Leña</li>
        <li>1 Kg chinchulín</li>
        <li>Sal parrillera, o que sea gruesa</li>
        <li>Chimi Churri</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>How to do it: </h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Kidney fat should be removed, then open the kidney transversely. Leave them in a bowl for 45 min in vinegar, put the chorizos in water.</li>
        <li>In that moment, light the embers. An approximate calculation is that per kilo of meat, one kilo of charcoal.</li>
        <li>Add salt to the meat, to taste. On the grill, try to evenly spread the charcoal on the grill pan.</li>
        <li>Put the strip on the bone side, as well as the other cuts, always on the bone or on the fat side.</li>
        <li>Turn and turn the meat when its juice begins to come out.</li>
        <li>The black pudding is placed on the spit when the meat is turned for the first time.</li>
        <li>Until here, since, the cooking is to taste. You can accompany the roast with salads, potatoes or peppers.</li>
    </ol>
