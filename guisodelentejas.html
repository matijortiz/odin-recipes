    <h1>This is 'Guiso de Lentejas'</h1>
    <p>Although the gastronomy in Argentina is characterized by having regional products such as wheat, beans, corn, soybeans, meat and milk, today eating an exquisite lentil stew leaves more than one tourist who knows the preparation wanting more.</p>

    <h1>How to do it: </h1>

    <ol>
        <li>The first thing we are going to do is cut the red chorizo into slices, and then each slice into four parts. We put the chorizo pieces in a pot with water and bring it to a boil for 15 minutes: this procedure will cause the chorizo to lose its fat and we will prevent the stew from being left with a lot of oil or a taste of chorizo.</li>
        <li>Cut the bacon into small pieces. This is to everyone's liking, but I like bacon in small pieces. We are going to cut the meat into slightly larger cubes (also to suit the consumer, I will tell you how I like it). Reserve.</li>
        <li>Chop the onion and garlic finely. We must also chop the bell pepper but it is not necessary for it to be so small. We continue with the potatoes and carrots, which we peel and cut into cubes and slices respectively.</li>
        <li>Chop the tomatoes and the dry tomatoes without hydrating. If you don't have dried tomatoes, it doesn't matter, they give it a lot of flavor but you can ignore them.</li>
        <li>Now let's go with the cooking: the first thing we do is place the pieces of bacon in a non-stick pot over high heat. We are not going to touch them until they start to make a cooking noise. At that time we are going to stir slowly and from time to time: the idea is that the bacon is very crispy and that it is not boiled, the key to the lentil stew.</li>
        <li>When the bacon is toasted, we add the previously drained red chorizo. Cook over high heat until the chorizo is also golden. When everything is well toasted, we are going to remove it from the pot and without cleaning it (since we want to have the bottom of the bacon and chorizo) we continue with the next step.</li>
        <li>The piece of bacon that I used was practically fat free, so I added a drizzle of olive oil to the pot. In most cases they will see that the pot already contains the fat that the bacon gave off, therefore they do not add anything to it.</li>
        <li>Add the meat and brown it in the same way that we browned the bacon: don't touch it until it starts to brown on one side, then move it a little bit and try to brown it on all sides. Remove the meat and again leave the cooking bottom so that this flavor can be used in the rest of the lentil stew.</li>
        <li>Add the onion, bell pepper and garlic. I added a little salt so that the vegetables release their water and remain very tender. Cook until the onion is transparent.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato to the pot and cook until it changes color to a deeper red, about 3 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Add all the meats (chorizo, bacon, and roast beef) and also a splash of wine. Wait for the wine to evaporate: for this we can be guided by the smell, when it no longer smells of alcohol it means that it has already evaporated. If you don't have a sense of smell, it's approximately 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes, carrots, and sun-dried tomatoes while stirring. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and a pinch of oregano. Finally we added a small glass of tomato puree. Do not skimp on the seasonings, remember that several servings will come out! An unseasoned lentil stew is bland.</li>
        <li>Now we are going to complete with the lentils and the hot water. It is time to add the bay leaf and stir. Cover the pot and let it cook over medium heat, from time to time open the pot and stir. It always has to be covered with water at the level of the lentils, ensuring that the water is always hot before adding it.</li>
        <li>Once the lentils are cooked, we wait for the water to finish evaporating and let it rest. This last tip is super important: if we let it rest for a few hours, the stew will get more flavor and it will be much tastier!</li>
    </ol>
