        <li>2 cebollas</li>
        <li>1 morrón rojo</li>
        <li>2 tomates</li>
        <li>1/4 de taza de vino tinto</li>
        <li>1 zanahoria</li>
        <li>600 gramos de carne picada magra</li>
        <li>300 cc de caldo de verduras</li>
        <li>1 cucharada de ají molido</li>
        <li>1 cucharada de pimentón</li>
        <li>1 pizca de sal</li>
        <li>1 pizca de pimienta negra</li>
        <li>2 hojitas de laurel</li>
        <li>1 cucharada de orégano</li>
        <li>2 cucharadas de aceite de oliva</li>
        <li>6 papas</li>
        <li>1 taza de leche</li>
        <li>2 cucharadas de manteca</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>How to do it: </h1>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, put the olive oil and the minced garlic. When the garlic begins to brown, add the onion and bell pepper, both cut into cubes.</li>
        <li>Let it cook for a few minutes and, as soon as the vegetables start to stick to the pan, deglaze with red wine (add the wine and scrape the pan to raise the cooking bottom).</li>
        <li>Let the alcohol evaporate for 2 or 3 minutes and add the tomato without skin and without seeds, cut into cubes, the carrot in very thin slices and the minced meat.</li>
        <li>Mix well, breaking up the meat blocks with a wooden spoon, and cook for a few minutes. Season with a little salt, pepper, paprika, ground chili, oregano and bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Add broth to cover and cook until the liquid is reduced, stirring so that it does not stick. Add more broth or water if necessary, to cook it for a long time.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, boil the peeled and diced potatoes until they are very tender. Make a puree and add the butter and milk. Season to your taste.</li>
        <li>Take the super juicy minced meat to a baking dish and cover with the puree. Gratinate in a strong oven and serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
